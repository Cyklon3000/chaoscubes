# chaoscubes

**Here the snippets from testground are put together**

Out of the snippets, developed in the testground, sites are assembled inside the chaoscubes sub-directory. This directory is planned on being brought online to make the service accessable to everyone.

The project currently relies on vite.

*Note: The GitHub Pages deployment only works with static elements and can therefor not be used to display dynamic background or most of the sites functionality. This includes the automated .scss to <style/> conversion.*
