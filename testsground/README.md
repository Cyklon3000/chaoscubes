# testground

**A way to experiment with snippets for the actual service**

The testground has been made, so new html snippets with their style or scripts can be build, tested and explored in an safe enviroment, disconnected from the website itself.

The project currently relies on vite.

*Note: The GitHub Pages deployment only works with static elements and can therefor not be used to display dynamic background or most of the sites functionality. This includes the automated .scss to <style/> conversion.*
