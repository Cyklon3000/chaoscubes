**A minecraft structure collection and creation service**

ChaosCubes is meant to be a website for sharing minecraft builds as .nbt files. The search will be tag based, making it possible to filter after materials uses and structures portrayed. A second service offered is the procedural generation of structure files, like houses, roofs and walls (planning on highly customizable structure creation)

The project currently relies on vite.

*Note: The GitHub Pages deployment only works with static elements and can therefor not be used to display dynamic background or most of the sites functionality. This includes the automated .scss to <style/> conversion.*
