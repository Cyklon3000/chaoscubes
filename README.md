# chaoscubes
**A minecraft structure collection and creation service**

ChaosCubes is meant to be a website for sharing minecraft builds as .nbt files. The search will be tag based, making it possible to filter after materials uses and structures portrayed. A second service offered is the procedural generation of structure files, like houses, roofs and walls (planning on highly customizable structure creation)

The project currently relies on vite.

*Note: The GitHub Pages deployment only works with static elements and can therefor not be used to display dynamic background or most of the sites functionality*
